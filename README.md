# Cryptor
A light-weight cryptography library.

Cryptor provides an easy to use interface for encryption and decryption. Also the library follows OOP patterns, therefore provides more control to those who uses it.

Currently only one cryptographic algorithm is made available, the "Caesar Cipher". However, more algorithms will be added soon.

This project is created while learning Cryptography with Python. So, it will take time to have more algorithms implemented. Also, the existing one's will be improved time to time.

To those who understands how useful cryptography is,
LUQVf! (Key = 7) ;)
